I'm a software engineer based in Seattle, Washington, with experience in JavaScript/Node.js, React, Ruby, PostgreSQL, AWS, Docker, and Go.

Most recently, I built [Constellation](https://constellation-load-testing.github.io/), an open-source, serverless framework that simplifies geographically distributed API load testing.
